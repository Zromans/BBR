# BBR Django Project

This Django project includes a `bbr` app for scraping and storing product data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Django 3.2 or higher
- Other dependencies (add as needed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

The provided codebase is for a Django web application that scrapes and manages product information from an auto parts website (eccppautoparts.com). The key components of the codebase include:

1. Django models:
   - `Product`: Represents a product with fields like name, price, and SKU.
   - `ProductDetail`: Stores additional details for a product, such as description and image URL.
   - `Make`: Represents a car, truck, or SUV make (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
   - `Model`: Represents a specific model of a make (e.g., Camry, F-150).
   - `Year`: Represents a year associated with a product.

2. Django management commands:
   - `scrape_product.py`: Scrapes product information from eccppautoparts.com using Scrapy and Selenium. It handles user login, starts the Scrapy spider, and imports the scraped data into the database.
   - `populate_makes.py`: Populates the database with a predefined list of car, truck, and SUV makes in the USA.

3. Scrapy spider:
   - `ProductSpider`: Defines the spider logic for scraping product information from eccppautoparts.com. It extracts details like name, price, description, and image URL.

The codebase aims to automate the process of scraping and importing product information from eccppautoparts.com into a Django database. It leverages Scrapy for web scraping, Selenium for handling user login, and Django's management commands for executing the scraping and data population tasks.

Enhancements and updates have been made to improve error handling, logging, and code organization. The codebase follows best practices and coding conventions to ensure readability and maintainability.

Please review the codebase and provide any further enhancements, optimizations, or suggestions to improve its functionality and performance. Let me know if you have any specific questions or areas you'd like me to focus on.
